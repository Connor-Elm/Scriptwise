        <h2>The start</h2>
        <p>We as students of Minarets highschool decided that for our SLE we were going to correct the programming curriculum by creating a hands on learning website. Through our experience in coding we decided it would be a great idea to help teach future generations of programmers how to code in a more effective and memorable way.</p>

        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>We are 2024 Graduate students Caden Halencak and Conner Elm. Caden, after moving schools for his senior year had already been programming for years prior. This experience and interest in programming helped develope this website. The idea of fixing the curriculum stemmed from the prior years he spent in Merced highschool. This school primarialy funded tech and sports classes and coming from this school Caden was shocked to see the state of the coding class. Determined to change it Caden and Conner Elm who felt the same way decided to do something about it and here we are typing on an HTML doctype explaining why we made the very website you are on!</p>
